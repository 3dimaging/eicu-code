As the APACHE tables are similar, a single notebook is used to summarize information about them.
Source code for this and other notebooks can be found at the code repository:
https://github.com/MIT-LCP/eicu-code/tree/master/notebooks

Note: if you do not see any content, your browser may be blocking javascript necessary for viewing the notebook. To circumvent this, either allow javascript to run on this site, or navigate to the notebook using the above GitHub link.
