# eICU Collaborative Research Database 

The [Philips eICU program](http://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/product/HCNOCTN503/eicu-program-telehealth-for-the-intensive-care-unit) is a transformational critical care telehealth program that delivers need-to-know information to caregivers, empowering them to care for the patients. It is a supplement — not a replacement — to the bedside team, and the data utilized by the remote care givers is archived for research purposes. 

Through this work, we have generated a large database which has potential for facilitating additional research initiatives on patient outcomes, trends, and other best practice protocols in use today at most healthcare facilities. The Philips eRI Institute, which maintains the data, has generously contributed the eICU Collaborative Research Database described here.

## Coverage

The eICU Collaborative Research Database is populated with data from a combination of many critical care units throughout the continental United States. The data in the collaborative database covers patients who were admitted to critical care units in 2013 and 2014.
