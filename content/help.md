# Help and support

As explained elsewhere on this website, the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, Philips Healthcare, and [our collaborators](/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. 

We therefore encourage eICU-CRD users to work together as a community. Please read [our notes on how to get involved](/community/contributing/) for further information.

# Contact us

Where possible we encourage public discussion via the methods described on the eICU Collaborative Research Database [Community page](/community/contributing/).

The dataset is complex and we understand that there are many open questions, both in terms of the data and its analysis. Public discussion reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and reduces workload on our laboratory. 

One exception is where a topic is sensitive, for example relating to patient health information. If you need to raise a private issue, please contact us at: [eicu-support@physionet.org](mailto:eicu-support@physionet.org).
