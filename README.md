# eICU Code Repository

This is a repository of code shared by the research community. The repository is intended to be a central hub for sharing, refining, and reusing code used for analysis of the [eICU critical care database](https://eicu.physionet.org). To find out more about MIMIC, please see: https://eicu.physionet.org
